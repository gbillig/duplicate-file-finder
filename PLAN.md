# Implementation Commit Plan

## Overview
This plan ensures each commit produces a working program with tests, building progressively from MVP to full solution.

## Commit Sequence

### 1. feat: Implement basic duplicate finder MVP
- CLI with single argument (folder path)
- Scan all files recursively
- Hash files using SHA256 (full content)
- Find and print duplicates + unique files
- Include basic unit tests
- **Working program:** Basic but functional duplicate finder

### 2. feat: Add progress bars for user feedback
- Add tqdm for file scanning progress
- Show hashing progress with file count
- Display current file being processed
- Add tests for progress reporting
- **Working program:** Same functionality, better UX

### 3. feat: Add multi-stage comparison optimization
- Stage 1: Group by file size (skip unique sizes)
- Stage 2: Partial hash (first 4KB) for same-size files
- Stage 3: Full hash only when partial matches
- Add tests for multi-stage logic
- **Working program:** Much faster, same results

### 4. perf: Optimize directory scanning for large file trees
- Replace list-based scanning with streaming approach
- Process files as discovered without collecting all paths
- Add progress updates during scanning
- Handle directories with 100k+ files efficiently
- Include performance tests for large directories
- **Working program:** Much faster scanning for large directories

### 5. feat: Improve output with duplicate groups
- Group duplicate files together
- Show file sizes and counts
- Separate duplicates from unique files list
- Add summary statistics
- Include output formatting tests
- **Working program:** Better organized output

### 6. feat: Implement smart folder duplicate detection
- Detect when entire folders are identical
- Show folder-level duplicates instead of individual files
- Reduce redundant output for duplicate folders
- Add comprehensive folder detection tests
- **Working program:** Core requirement met - smart folder detection

### 7. feat: Add error handling and robustness
- Handle permission errors gracefully
- Skip broken symlinks
- Continue on errors with warning messages
- Add tests for error cases
- **Working program:** Production-ready robustness

### 8. feat: Add output format options
- Add --output flag (text/json)
- Implement JSON output for scripting
- Add --verbose and --quiet modes
- Include tests for different output formats
- **Working program:** Flexible output options

### 9. perf: Add parallel I/O processing optimization
- Replace sequential file hashing with parallel ThreadPoolExecutor
- Process multiple files simultaneously for better CPU/disk utilization
- Adaptive worker count based on system capabilities
- Maintain progress tracking at file level instead of group level
- Add tests for parallel processing behavior
- **Working program:** Much faster hashing for large directories

### 10. perf: Add memory-efficient stage processing
- Implement streaming batch processing for size analysis
- Cache partial hashes to eliminate redundant calculations
- Process files in batches to reduce memory footprint
- Early cleanup of single-file size groups
- Optimize memory usage for very large file sets
- **Working program:** Constant memory usage regardless of directory size

### 11. perf: Add adaptive worker optimization
- Dynamic worker count based on system resources (CPU cores, disk type)
- Balance between I/O throughput and system load
- Separate worker pools for different operations (partial vs full hashing)
- Include system detection and performance tuning
- Add configuration options for manual tuning
- **Working program:** Optimal performance across different systems

### 12. docs: Add complete documentation
- README with usage examples
- Performance characteristics
- Installation guide
- **Working program:** Well-documented and complete

## Key Principles
- Each commit includes both implementation and tests
- Every commit produces a working, runnable program
- Progressive enhancement from simple to optimized
- Core requirements prioritized (especially smart folder detection)
- No feature bloat - only essential functionality
