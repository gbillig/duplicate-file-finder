# Fast HDD Strategy Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements a metadata-based duplicate detection system optimized for HDDs with large file counts (400k+ files). Each commit produces a working program with tests, building progressively from MVP to full solution.

**Target Performance**: 400k files in 2-5 minutes instead of hours, with acceptable false positives for personal file management.

## Commit Sequence

### 1. feat: Implement metadata-based duplicate finder MVP
- CLI with --fast flag for metadata-only mode
- Scan files collecting only filesystem metadata (name, size, mtime)
- Group files by exact filename match (case-insensitive)
- Within groups, compare size and modification time
- Basic duplicate reporting with confidence levels
- Include basic unit tests
- **Working program:** Fast metadata-only duplicate finder

### 2. feat: Simplify to filename + size matching
- Simple duplicate detection: same filename + same file size = duplicate
- Remove complex date/time comparisons (not needed for exact duplicates)
- Keep file categorization for future use but simplify matching logic
- Much faster processing without unnecessary complexity
- Add tests for simplified matching
- **Working program:** Fast, accurate duplicate detection

### 3. feat: Add output formatting and reporting
- Detailed duplicate reports with file paths and metadata
- Summary statistics: total files, duplicates by confidence, potential space savings
- JSON output option for scripting integration  
- Group duplicates by confidence level in output
- Include output formatting tests
- **Working program:** Professional duplicate reporting

### 4. feat: Add Windows-specific optimizations
- Windows path handling and case sensitivity
- NTFS alternate data streams awareness
- Windows file attribute handling
- Optimize for Windows filesystem characteristics
- Add Windows-specific tests
- **Working program:** Optimized for Windows 10 target environment

### 5. docs: Add comprehensive documentation
- README with fast mode usage examples
- Performance benchmarks vs hash-based approach
- Windows setup and usage guide
- **Working program:** Well-documented fast duplicate finder

## Key Principles
- Each commit includes both implementation and tests
- Every commit produces a working, runnable program  
- Progressive enhancement from simple metadata matching to sophisticated detection
- Performance prioritized over perfect accuracy
- Optimized for personal file collections (photos, videos, documents)
- Windows 10 and HDD-friendly I/O patterns

## Performance Targets
- **400k files**: 2-5 minutes total processing time
- **Memory usage**: <500MB constant regardless of file count
- **Disk I/O**: Minimal - single directory scan + selective EXIF reads
- **Accuracy**: Optimized for files with same names in different folders
